### webhost.py

This script allows you to host a live wevserver with your godot 4 games, currently there is an issue if you try to open the HTML that can be solved by running `python webhost.py` inside of the folder that you build is in (make sure you copy webhost.py to that folder first)

The default port is 8000, you can also specify a port when calling the command.

This is a script I found on a godot forum that I wanted to upload for my own personal use on github, just so I wouldn't lose it.
